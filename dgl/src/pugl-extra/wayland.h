/* NOTE: This header deliberately does not include wayland-client.h, wayland-cursor.h, the xkbcommon
   headers, or the generated protocol headers.

   The Wayland backend is compiled as part of the dgl/src/pugl.cpp unity build, which pulls those
   system headers in at global scope (with C linkage) *before* it enters the DGL namespace, and only
   then includes wayland.c.  Including them again from here would be a no-op at best (include
   guards) and, if this header were ever included from inside the namespace without the global
   includes having happened first, would declare a whole second set of namespaced Wayland types that
   could never link.  The elaborated type specifiers below therefore resolve, by ordinary unqualified
   lookup, to the global declarations.  See the HAVE_WAYLAND arm near the top of pugl.cpp. */
